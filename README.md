<h2> Here is a basic Makefile with some mains to evaluate the 42 libft project.</h2>
<p6 align="center">This is, aside from being a modest project, my first contribution—if you can even call it that. I’m happy if you find it useful! It’s a small semi-automatic Makefile where all you have to do is download the repo and place it in the folder with your .c and .h files. Once you have the repository, you just need to go inside it and run make. The Makefile will take care of creating a compiled file in your folder along with your functions, and once you execute this compiled file, it will start compiling all your functions. If your functions use other functions, in theory, it will take that into account; otherwise, it wouldn't compile. If you only want to compile a single function, run the compiled file and write the name of the function without the .c, like this: ./mains_libft ft_bzero. If you want to delete it, you would use the same syntax but with a clean before the function name: ./mains_libft clean ft_bzero. When you execute any of the commands to create the functions, a src folder is created with the .o files inside.
