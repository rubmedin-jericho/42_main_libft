<h2> Here is a basic Makefile with some mains to evaluate the 42 libft project.</h2>
<p6 align="center">This is, aside from being a modest project, my first contribution—if you can even call it that. I’m happy if you find it useful! It’s a small semi-automatic Makefile where all you have to do is download the repo and place it in the folder with your .c and .h files. Once it’s in place, you just need to use this syntax when running make: "make TARGET=function_name", and the compiled file will be created in the folder where your .c files are. Also, if you want to delete all the .o files and the compiled output, just use the same syntax but with make clean: "make clean TARGET=function_name". These are very basic main files, but if you want to tweak them, as long as you don’t change the filenames (so make doesn’t get confused), everything should work just fine!

This is, besides being a small project, my first contribution—if you can even call it that. I'm happy if you find it useful! It's a simple program, you just need to compile it with: 'cc auto_42_main.c' or 'gcc auto_42_main.c' and then use the compiled file.

 You can run the compiled file without any parameters, and it will create the compiled files in the same folder where your .c files are.
 1.If you only want to compile one function: './a.out ft_function', and it will only compile that function.
 2.If you want to delete all compiled files, just run: './a.out clean', and everything will be deleted.
 3.If you only want to delete a specific function, use: './a.out clean ft_function'.
