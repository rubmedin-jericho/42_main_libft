<h2> Here is a basic Makefile with some mains to evaluate the 42 libft project.</h2>

This is, besides being a small project, my first contributionâ€”if you can even call it that. I'm happy if you find it useful! It's a simple program, you just need to compile it with: 'cc auto_42_main.c' or 'gcc auto_42_main.c' and then use the compiled file.

 You can run the compiled file without any parameters, and it will create the compiled files in the same folder where your .c files are.
 1.If you only want to compile one function: './a.out ft_function', and it will only compile that function.
 2.If you want to delete all compiled files, just run: './a.out clean', and everything will be deleted.
 3.If you only want to delete a specific function, use: './a.out clean ft_function'.
